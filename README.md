## Description
Our project is a meme sharing platform that can be used by anyone. It allows users to add memes of their own
or ones they have found by submitting links. Users can also share comments and provide thumbs up or down for the 
 memes reviewed. 

We wanted to provide a place where friends could go and share memes and comments with a more streamlined interface.
We built this project to provide a repository of memes to be shared amongst friends. This application allows for users
to either like or dislike and provide a comment on memes posted throughout the day.
